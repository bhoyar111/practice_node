Middleware means incomming request is automaticaly funneled through a bunch of function by express.js 
so instead of just having on request handler. you will actually have 
possibility of hooking in multiple function which request will go through until you send a response.
This allow to you to split your code into multiple blocks or pieces insted of having one huge function
that does everything and this is the pluggable nature of expressjs where you can easily add other thired party packages.
which simply happen to give you such middleware function that you can plug into express.js and add certain functionality
